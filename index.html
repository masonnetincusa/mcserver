  <h1>What is this server about?</h1>
  <p>This server is about <i>everything</i> honestly. This is a chill server. You can chill out or do whatever you want, even having the possibility of earning creative mode access! You start out in survival, and you decide where you want to go from there! You can call this a <b>fun</b> server, I guess.</p>

  <h1>Additional information</h1>
  <p>Server owner and super admin: MASONNET</p>
  <p>Admins: jaxonpoopy16</p>
  <p>Note: This is a semi-low performance server. We will upgrade this server once we reach a higher average player count. The java.net.SocketException: Connection reset error occurs if you are sending too much data to the server. You will get kicked out when you see this error message, but you can just rejoin again. It can happen repeatedly and can get very annoying after a while, but that is because we need to upgrade the server, which we will when we have a higher player count. The max player count is 1,000,000, but the server can't handle that many players at the same time right now.</p>
  <p>More information will be added soon!</p>
